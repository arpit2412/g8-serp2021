## SERP Project 8 - Evaluating Cross Domain Vulnerability Detection Methods

This project explores evaluating various deep learning based cross-project vulnerability detection methods. Methods from different research papers will be replicated to provide a baseline for our evaluation framework. Our framework will be reproducible and can be adopted into future reseach for determining the optimum vulnerability detection method. Research papers(scope), source code, and feature extraction tools will be provided within this repository.
