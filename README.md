## SERP Project 8 - Evaluating Cross Domain Vulnerability Detection Methods

This project explores evaluating various deep learning based cross-project vulnerability detection methods. Methods from different research papers will be replicated to provide a baseline for our evaluation framework. Our framework will be reproducible and can be adopted into future reseach for determining the optimum vulnerability detection method. Research papers(scope), source code, and feature extraction tools will be provided within this repository.<br /><br />

## Tools

## Papers Replicated
### POSTER: Vulnerability Discovery with Function Representation Learning from Unlabeled Projects 
This project explores using function-level vulnerability discovery within a cross-project scope. The AST representation will be the training data used for a bidirectional LSTM neural network. The function level representation model machine learning model has demonstrated significant performance gains.<br />
